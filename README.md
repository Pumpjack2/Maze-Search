# Maze-Search


This project was made during my unit Introduction to Programming within my Bachelor of Computer Sceince / Bachelor of Game Studies at Swinbunre University.

During Week 6 of my first semester at uni as a Distinction task we were instructed to make a Maze Search program using Ruby and GOSU.

This is the final result and i hope you enjoy.
